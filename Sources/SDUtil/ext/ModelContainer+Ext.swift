    * Wipe
    * - Abstract: Clears all data for the specified models from the database.
    * - Description: This method clears all data associated with the specified models from 
    *                the database. It iterates through each model type in the provided array,
    *                creates a new ModelContext instance for each, and attempts to delete all
    *                data associated with that model type. If any deletion operation fails,
    *                an error message is logged.
    * - Side Effects: This method modifies the database by removing data associated with the specified models. It does not return a value but logs an error message if any of the deletion operations fail.
    * - Note: This method is designed to provide a convenient way to clear data for specific models in the database. It is particularly useful for scenarios where a complete reset of specific models is required, such as during testing or when initializing a new database.
    * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Remember to reset the `shared.container` instance, - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è elaborate?
    * - Note: there is also: `container.deleteAllData()` not sure what deleteAllData does
    * - Note: Alternative names for this: `reset`, `destroy`, `nuke`, `remove`, `obliterate`, `zap`
    * - Note there is also `SDUtil.resetDB`
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è add some explination for the models type, its strange, maybe us copilot if there is nothing in legacy etc?
    * - Parameters:
    *   - models: An array of `PersistentModel` types for which all data should be cleared from the database.
    * - Returns: This method does not return a value. It modifies the database by removing data associated with the specified models.
