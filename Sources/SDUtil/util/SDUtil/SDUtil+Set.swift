    * Removes the database file at the specified URL.
    * - Description: This method checks if a database file exists at the given URL and 
    *                attempts to remove it if it does. This operation is useful for 
    *                resetting the database state, especially when model changes occur.
    *                However, in a production environment, it is recommended to use
    *                a migration schema instead of removing the database file.
    * - Note: If model changes, sometimes we just reset the db
    * - Note: This method does not throw an error if the file does not exist or if the removal fails. It is recommended to modify this method to throw an error in such cases.
    * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Use migrationSchema if it's in production
    * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Move to URL scope or? add reasoning etc
    * - Parameter url: The URL of the database file to be removed.
    * - Returns: This method does not return a value. It modifies the file system by removing the database file if it exists.

    * - Description: This method is a temporary solution for resetting the database file. 
    *                It is designed to remove all data associated with the specified database
    *                configuration. The method attempts to wipe all data for the models defined
    *                in the database configuration and then deletes the database file itself.
    * - Note: Alternative names for this: `reset`, `destroy`, `nuke`, `remove`, `obliterate`, `zap`
    * - Remark: Seems like this does not work if we use getContainer in the code, it works if we use the lazy container
    * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Do some more research into wiping dbs in swiftdata etc
    * - Parameter db: The database configuration for which the database file is to be reset.
