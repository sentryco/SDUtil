 * SwiftDataUtil - "SDUtil" for short
 * - Description: SDUtil is a utility class designed to provide a set of helper 
 *                methods and functionalities for working with SwiftData.
 *                It aims to simplify common database operations and offer a more
 *                convenient interface for developers to interact with the database.
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ We could make `SDUtil` it's own package. With it's own tests etc?, seperation of concerns etc
